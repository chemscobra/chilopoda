Made with Octet Game Framework, designed and implemented by Andy Thomason

October-November 2013

Chilopoda is a Centipede clone (google Atari Centipede for more information). The game 
was made to demonstrate regular use of container structures made in the framework and
a simple custom shader that goes a bit more than the usual examples.

You will find a gameplay video in Youtube, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzAWITWJxCA

This was an assignment for the subject Introduction to Game Programming for the MSc
Computer Games & Entertainment course at Goldsmiths, London, UK.

Octet is a cross-platform game development framework for developing games on Windows,
Mac and other platforms.

It is designed to be very simple, dependency-free and very fast to build.
